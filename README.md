# Continuing Educations Projects

## What is This Repo?
This holds various projects I'm working on to generally expand my knowledge, while at the same time furthering my programming skills. I'll be starting by working through Eugene Izhikevich's [Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience](https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/dsn.pdf), where I'll implement the provided equations and MATLAB code in Python. From there, I'll be building upon these lessons through various projects, including  using [BeyondML](https://github.com/Beyond-ML-Labs/BeyondML) and spiking neural networks to deploy models to edge device, including a mobile robotics platform).
