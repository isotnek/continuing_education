# A Confluence of Very, Very Cool Things
The skillset required for computational neuroscience is deep and multifaceted. The combination of requisite quantitative skills - applied mathematics (statistics, machine learning, etc.) and dynamical systems / control theory - reflects an ability which enables a scientist to, in the words of JeepÂ®, go anywhere and do anything. More importantly, computational neuroscience is inherently fascinating!


## What is This Repo?
This project is an opportunity for me to further develop my skills in the above domains, while at the same time furthering my programming skills. I'll be starting by working through Eugene Izhikevich's [Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience](https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/dsn.pdf), where I'll implement the provided equations and MATLAB code in Python. From there, I'll be building upon these lessons through various projects, including  using [BeyondML](https://github.com/Beyond-ML-Labs/BeyondML) and spiking neural networks to deploy models to edge device, including a mobile robotics platform).
